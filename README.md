# Grid Component Generator

This is geared for Design Systems who use Flexbox based Grid components to generate Grid component markup for developers to copy/paste to easily add to their features or to preview in a sandbox.

This project was insired by Sarah Drasner's [CSS Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.com/).

The color palette used is from [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/162867). All colors have been tested for [color constrast](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

Font is Lato from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?selection.family=Lato).

The input and select components are using [`@matthamlin/property-controls` package](https://github.com/hamlim/projects/tree/master/packages/property-controls), which implements FramerX like Property Controls for any React component.

Special thanks to [Matt Hamlin](https://github.com/hamlim/) for his help!
